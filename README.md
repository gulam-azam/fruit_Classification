# Fruit Image Classification with Deep Neural Network

## Overview
This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system for classifying fruit images and retrieving nutritional information. The goal is to provide a user-friendly, accurate method for identifying various fruits and delivering detailed nutritional data, focusing on calorie content.

## Methodology
Using a dataset of 78,066 fruit images from 53 categories, the system employs a MobileNetV2 architecture for accurate fruit classification. Upon identification, an integrated API fetches extensive nutritional information, including vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients.

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating robust applicability in educational, dietary, and commercial sectors by enhancing nutritional awareness and automating fruit sorting processes.

## Future Enhancements
Future improvements will include expanding the diversity of fruit images and refining the model to enhance recognition accuracy for visually similar fruits.

## Fruit App Website
Upload a fruit Image and see the magic. Currently it can identify 53 Categories of fruits.
